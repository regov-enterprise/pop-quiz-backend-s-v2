# Welcome to this PopQuiz!
### { "Engineer": "Backend" }

### Coding Challenge

## Question 1

Write an API service for Medical Laboratory Inventory Management System called MLI. The MLI system should allow lab technician to do the following:

1. Onboarding new patient for medical testing, and offboarding existing patient
2. The patient would only provide personal credentials for the lab technican to help setup the account
3. The patient should be able to provide OTP via mobile, email, or other MFA devices during sign up
4. Administrator should be able to register new patient and add patient in a group
5. Administrator should be able to add an infant or child to parents record / account
6. Administrator should be able to search patient records
7. The system must ensure the same login credentials can not be used twice


## Question 2 

Data structures

### Exercise 1:

Given an array of integers, find the two elements that sum up to a given target. 
For example, given the array [2, 7, 11, 10, 3, 15, 44] and the target 14, the function should return [11, 3].

### Exercise 3: 
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1. For example, given the string "sseemless", the function should return 4 because the first non-repeating character is 'm'.

### Notes

- Use Node.js | Python
- Apply your preferred coding practice and style
- Unit test is an added advantage
- Add README
- Produce use case or class diagram for the system architecture 
- Writing design documents will attract extra points :)
